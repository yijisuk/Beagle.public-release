## Our Solutions
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Company financials analysis & evaluation

Complex market analysis tasks are automated to present essential insights about any company.

The process begins with a comprehensive assessment of a company's financial statements. Our internal algorithm extracts essential data from income, balance, and cashflow statements, then calculates ratio metrics. These metrics are used to provide an objective score on the company's financial state, based on predefined classifications: Liquidity, Operation Efficiency, Profitability, Business Stability, Financial Stability, Overall Stability, and Valuation.

The organized evaluation scores are integrated with the GPT-4 Large Language Model (LLM), providing a comprehensive evaluation.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Market screener

Investment success depends on both identifying companies with solid financials and gauging the optimal market entry time. 

The TradingView widget is incorporated to display a live daily market heatmap, showcasing the most recent market changes.
  
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Economy overview

Understanding the broader economic landscape is vital, as economic conditions significantly dictate the flow of money. Insights are primarily derived from [JPMorgan Asset Management](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/economic-update/)'s weekly reports, providing a succinct weekly summary of economic evaluations. 

Additionally, TradingView widgets for the economic calendar and forex heatmap are integrated for a more rounded perspective.
